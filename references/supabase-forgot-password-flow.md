# Supabase Forgot Password Flow

This document outlines the typical forgot password flow when using Supabase with a Nuxt 3 application.

## Overview

1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login form
2. User enters email on forgot password page
3. Application sends reset password email via Supabase
4. User clicks reset link in email
5. User lands on reset password page
6. User enters new password
7. Application updates password via Supabase
8. User is redirected to login or automatically authenticated

## Detailed Flow

### 1. Forgot Password Link

- Add a "Forgot Password" link to your login form
- Link should navigate to a dedicated forgot password page

### 2. Forgot Password Page

- Create a new page component (e.g., `pages/forgot-password.vue`)
- Include a form with an email input field

### 3. Sending Reset Email

- Use Supabase's `auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` method
- Example:

```javascript
try {
  await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email)
  // Show success message
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error
}
```

### 4. Reset Password Link

- Supabase sends an email with a password reset link
- Link includes a special token in the URL

### 5. Reset Password Page

- Create a new page component (e.g., `pages/reset-password.vue`)
- This page should be accessible without full authentication
- Extract the token from the URL

### 6. New Password Form

- Include a form with fields for the new password (and confirmation)
- Implement client-side validation for password strength, match, etc.

### 7. Updating Password

- Use Supabase's `auth.updateUser()` method with the token
- Example:

```javascript
try {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({
    password: newPassword
  })
  if (error) throw error
  // Password updated successfully
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error
}
```

### 8. Completion

- After successful password reset,
  - Redirect to the login page with a success message

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `pages/forgot-password.vue`
2. Create `pages/reset-password.vue`
3. Implement Supabase auth methods in your Nuxt app
4. Add error handling and success messages
5. Test the flow thoroughly

## Security Considerations

- Ensure reset tokens have a short expiration time
- Implement rate limiting on password reset requests
- Use HTTPS for all authentication-related requests
- Follow best practices for password strength and storage

Remember to consult the official Supabase documentation for the most up-to-date API methods and best practices.

## Suggestions
When using Nuxt.js with Supabase for authentication, it's important to handle the redirect after a user resets their password properly. If the email reset password link is redirecting the user to the home page and they are authenticated, it may be due to the way the routing and authentication state are managed.

### Recommendations
Redirect to a Specific Page: After the user resets their password, ensure that you redirect them to a specific page that does not include any route prefetching. This is to avoid any issues with the access and refresh tokens not being set properly.

#### Check Authentication State: 
Make sure to check the authentication state before rendering the home page. You can do this by using the Supabase client to verify if the user is authenticated and then conditionally render the appropriate content.

#### Use Middleware: 
You can create a middleware in Nuxt.js to check if the user is authenticated before allowing access to certain pages. This can help manage the flow of authenticated and unauthenticated users.

## Example Middleware
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how you might set up middleware to check authentication:

1// middleware/auth.js
2export default function ({ store, redirect }) {
3  const user = store.state.auth.user; // Assuming you have a Pinia store for auth
4  if (!user) {
5    return redirect('/login'); // Redirect to login if not authenticated
6  }
7}

## Handling the Reset Link
When the user clicks the reset password link in their email, ensure that the link directs them to a page where they can enter their new password. After successfully resetting their password, you can redirect them to a specific page (like a login page) instead of the home page.

By following these recommendations, you should be able to manage the authentication flow more effectively and prevent users from being redirected to the home page when they should not be authenticated.
