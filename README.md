   git clone https://github.com/monkeyman1979/nuxt3-boilerplate.git
   cd nuxt3-boilerplate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Environment Setup**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash

   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
   ```

4. **Development Server**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Build for Production**

   To build the application for production:

## Authentication

This boilerplate implements a unified authentication system that combines both passkey and magic link methods on a single login screen. This approach provides users with a seamless and flexible authentication experience.

Key features of the authentication system:

1. **Passkey Authentication**: 
   - Allows users to sign up and sign in using passkeys.
   - Provides a secure, passwordless authentication experience.
   - Leverages the Web Authentication API for enhanced security.

2. **Magic Link Authentication**:
   - Enables users to sign up or sign in by receiving a secure link via email.
   - Offers a convenient alternative for users who prefer email-based authentication.

3. **Unified Interface**:
   - Presents both authentication options on a single screen.
   - Allows users to choose their preferred method at the point of login.

To implement this authentication system:

1. Configure Supabase Authentication in your project dashboard.
2. Enable both Passkey and Magic Link authentication methods in the Supabase Auth settings.
3. Create a unified login component in your Nuxt application.
4. Use the Supabase Vue library to handle authentication logic.
5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback for both authentication methods.

For detailed implementation instructions and best practices, refer to the Supabase documentation on [Passkey authentication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwordless-login/auth-passkeys) and [Magic Link authentication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwordless-login/auth-magic-link).

## Customization

- **Tailwind CSS**: Customize the `tailwind.config.js` file to modify your project's design system.
- **shadcn-vue**: Add or modify components in the `components/ui/` directory.
- **Pinia Stores**: Create new stores in the `stores/` directory.
- **API Routes**: Add serverless API routes in the `server/api/` directory.
- **Layouts**: Create custom layouts in the `layouts/` directory.

## Best Practices

- Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling components, including the authentication screen.
- Leverage VueUse composables for common functionalities.
- Use Pinia for state management across components, including managing authentication state.
- Implement Supabase for backend functionalities and user authentication.
- Use Stripe for payment processing (ensure PCI compliance when handling payment information).
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API best practices in your components and composables.
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback for authentication processes.
- Ensure the unified authentication UI is intuitive, accessible, and responsive.
- Provide clear instructions for users on how to use both passkey and magic link options.
- Implement appropriate security measures, such as rate limiting, to prevent abuse of the authentication system.
- Regularly update dependencies and follow security best practices for authentication implementation.
